# Logistic-Regression-on-Amazon-reviews-data-set.
Logistic Regression algorithm is applied on amazon reviews datasets to predict whether a review is positive or negative. 
Procedure to execute the above task is as follows: 
 --> • Step1: Data Pre-processing is applied on given amazon reviews data-set.And Take sample of data from dataset because of computational limitations 
 --> • Step2: Time based splitting on train and test datasets. 
 --> • Step3: Apply Feature generation techniques(Bow,tfidf,avg w2v,tfidfw2v)
 --> • Step4: Apply Logistic Regression algorithm using each technique.
 --> • Step5: To find lambda using gridsearch cross-validation and random cross-validation 
 --> • Step5: L1 and L2 regularization 
 --> • Step6: L1 Regularization- Increase lambda hyperparameter to generate sparcity in dataset.
            1. Report Performance metric
            2. Report Error 
            3. Report Sparcity in "W*"
 ## • Step6: Feature Importance for postive and Negative reviews 
            1. Most Important Feature
            2. Bar plot of top 15 Important Features.

## Objective : • To classify given reviews (positive (Rating of 4 or 5) &amp; negative (rating of 1 or 2)) using Logistic regression algorithm.
